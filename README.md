# dropboxmusic

A Flutter project just implement a streaming app like Spotify by hosting my own music from Dropbox.

## Getting Started

## How it works

The music files were hosted on dropbox and organized in genre folders and also by artist albums. And after spedning sometime in understanding dropbox api, I used only the list_folder and download implementation from the dropbox api. The list_folder to open a folder of artist and show contents in the folder while download is used to download the music for playing.

### note

Only the main file was used, other were to be used to make the application better.
